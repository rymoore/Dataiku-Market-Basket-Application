       - efficient-apriori
       - dataclasses

2) Import the MARKETBASKETAPPLICATION.zip project (New Project=>Import Project)
   - If there are any Code Environment errors, add the mapping between `market_basket_app` and the environment you imported / created in step 1
   
3) Navigate to the Application Designer page (Top Nav=>...=>Application Designer) and click "Test" to run the application

4) Select a Country from the dropdown, run the scenario and view the results
